# party-managed
Party management system is a web application. Here you can add your guest name, number and food type. The information will show as a card. You can mark whoâ€™s confirmed to come to this party. To use this web app first you have to register and then login. After inserting your guest details the site will count which type of guest are invited and also count which type of guest is confirmed. At the last moment, you can order food easily. I have used functional based components or react hooks in this site. To store data, I have used mongo db. I used heroku to deploy this site.
